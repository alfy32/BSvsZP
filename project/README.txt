During this assignment I have completed:

* All of the execution strategies. As much of them as I can. I hadn't started them before this assignment.
* The brain stubs.
* The AgentState class with delegates and events for the GUI.
* The AgentGUI project. It is non-trivial. I have never made a C# GUI before now. It uses events and delegates to update.
